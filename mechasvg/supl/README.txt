**mechaSVG**

mechaSVG is a python & tk application for creating good-looking energy profile diagrams as *Scalable Vector Graphics* or **'.svg'** files with various aesthetic options. The produced graphics can also be easily edited afterwards via an svg editor like Inkscape. Extra analysis for catalytic cycle diagrams include: Finding energy span, Turn Over Frequency (TOF) estimation from both energy span and *catalytic-flux law*, and estimating degree of TOF control of both intermediates and transition states.

**Latest updates**

-Various graph styles and personalization options added.

-Make energy comparisons betwen structures.

-Plot up to 30 structures 2D PES (Potential Energy Surface).

-Slight modifications to the user interface.

-Support for ".txt" and ".xlsx" imports and exports added. Please refer to section "**Importing .txt and .xlsx**" for information about importing these file types.

**Installing & Running**

The recommended installaion requires python 3.6 or above.

Fresh instalation can be done via:

**How to cite**

I don't actually require users to cite the software at all, so you can take any liberty in how or whether you cite it. However, a citation would greatly help to spread the visibility and adoption of this project which is my main goal.

If you intend to cite it, the following citation should suffice:

Angnes, R. A. mechaSVG, GitHub repository, 2020, doi: 10.5281/zenodo.3970267.
